Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, also known as the "Missile Man of India," was one of the most respected and beloved leaders in Indian history. Born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he came from a humble background. Despite financial difficulties, he pursued his education diligently, eventually studying aerospace engineering at the Madras Institute of Technology.
Kalam began his career as a scientist at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and later moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). He played a crucial role in developing India's first indigenous satellite launch vehicle and was instrumental in the success of the Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998. His contributions to India’s defense and space capabilities earned him the nickname "Missile Man."
Beyond his scientific achievements, Dr. Kalam was known for his simplicity, integrity, and deep love for the youth of India. He believed in the power of education and often interacted with students across the country, inspiring them to dream big and work hard. His famous book, “Wings of Fire,” is an autobiographical account that continues to motivate generations.
In 2002, he was elected as the 11th President of India and served until 2007. During his presidency, he was often referred to as the "People’s President" due to his accessible and compassionate nature. Even after his term ended, he continued his mission of nation-building through education and innovation.
Dr. Kalam passed away on July 27, 2015, while delivering a lecture at IIM Shillong, leaving behind a legacy of vision, humility, and dedication. His life continues to serve as a beacon of inspiration for all Indians, especially the youth who see him not just as a scientist or a leader, but as a symbol of what dedication and perseverance can achieve.
